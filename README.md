- 👋 Hi, I’m Marco Moreira

- 👀 I first stumbled upon coding in 11th grade where we were challenged to make a game with Visual Basic. In 12th grade we developed a Wordpress website as a challenge. From there, I gained a passion for programming. In college I further developed my knowledge for web development. In my second year, through class projects, I discovered that backend development is my preferred stack. With an internship and by developing my very first website with two other colleagues , I decided to go all in on backend development. I'm currently in my third and final year of college.
